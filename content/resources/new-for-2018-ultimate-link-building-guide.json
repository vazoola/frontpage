Why You Should Not Wait to Get Started\t27\n\n![Vazoola Premier Link Building & Influencer Marketing Platform](/images/uploads/vazoola-logo-for-white-paper.png)\n\n## PREFACE:  What You Don’t Know Can Hurt You\n\nYou may be tempted to ignore SEO and hope your site will do fine without it. The problem with doing so is that what you don’t know can hurt you. \n\nMany site owners have endured the pain, lost time, and expense of trying to recover from penalties in spite of never having built links intentionally. \n\nEven if you do not choose to build links yourself, knowing how to analyze your link profile and guard against negative SEO is imperative. \n\nRead on to find out how. \n\n# Ultimate Link Building Guide 2018\n\nWhile Google may claim that links are not as important as they once were, every ranking factor publication put out by SEOs who do testing shows they are still the [\\#1 factor in getting a site to rank](https://theupperranks.com/blog/backlinks/). \n\nStone Temple did extensive research in 2017 [proving links remain a powerful ranking factor](https://www.stonetemple.com/link-as-a-ranking-factor/). \n\nAttracting links organically by publishing exceptional content could work, but only if the content is so well-promoted that writers can find it. \n\nIf a site does not have enough authority for its content to appear in search, it surely will not be found in a search engine. \n\nBecause journalists and bloggers primarily use search engines when researching, if your content is not visible there it is unlikely to end up linked to in their content. \n\nThat leaves social media and outreach to build links. So link building will continue to be necessary into the foreseeable future.\n\n## 1.\tDo Keyword Research First\n\nKnowing what keyword phrases are most important to your site and business is the first step. It guides what content you create, publish, and promote and what links you want to acquire. \n\nSEOs use many premium tools which we will discuss later in this paper. But the free [Ubersuggest keyword research tool ](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/)is sufficient to get started. It pulls data from Google which only those who have high AdWords spends can access directly now. \n\nStart with the general words that describe what you offer. Then follow the tips on [how to use Ubersuggest here](http://growmap.com/powerful-keyword-research/). \n\nNarrow your keyword phrases down to those that are highly relevant. Decide by asking yourself whether someone searching for that phrase would be specifically looking for what you offer. \n\n## 1.1 Organizing Your Keyword Research\n\nKeyword research can be exported into spreadsheets. While many exclusively use spreadsheets, others prefer a more visual method. \n\nThe free project management tool Trello is ideal for prioritizing your keywords. You can learn to use it in ten minutes. See this [Trello 101 to get started](https://trello.com/guide/trello-101). \n\nCreate columns for:\n\n* priority\n* too general\n* too competitive\n* specific niches\n* low priority \n\nThen create a card for each keyword phrase showing the keyword, search volume, CPC, and competition value on the front of the card. \n\nEasily sort cards by priority. Create one piece of pillar content for each keyword phrase and add the URL of that content to the card. \n\nThen start building links to that content. Pillar content is also referred to as cornerstone or flagship content.\n\n## 2.\tQuality of Links\n\nBefore you build links, get familiar with how to judge the quality of a site. Various companies have provided metrics to assist in site evaluation. \n\nThe most commonly used is the Moz Domain Authority (DA). Install the free Moz toolbar in your browser to check the DA of any site. Just navigate to a site and activate the toolbar. \n\nAlso available on the toolbar is Page Authority (PA). Where DA is Moz’ estimate of the authority of the main URL of that domain, PA is the authority of any individual page. \n\nURL stands for uniform resource locator. It is what you type into your browser to go to a site online and how that content is found and displayed to you. \n\nIt is important to note that Google states that they score pages on a per URL basis, not over a full domain. But it is still useful to have some idea of the authority a domain may pass to a particular page using Moz’ DA. \n\nAlthough other tools pull data from Moz, they draw from an older version that is not updated as frequently. So the data on the toolbar is the most accurate. \n\nOther metrics available from Moz are MozTrust (mT) and MozRank (mR). On the toolbar, click the Page Analysis (first icon on the left next to “Moz”) to get to these. \n\nThen click on Link Metrics. If a site has a mR or mT, you will see it on that page along with PA and DA. \n\n## 2.1 Relevance is Extremely Important\n\nA pervasive mistake in building links is not to put enough emphasis on relevance. An incoming link from a highly related site is much more valuable than a link from a higher value but less related site. \n\nFocus on getting many very relevant sites in your niche to link to your content. A link from a relevant site is more important than a link from any unrelated site. \n\nLinks from content specifically about your keyword phrase from a quality site that is about your niche should be your priority. \n\nThat does not mean other links may not be valuable. Only the most relevant links should be your target. \n\n## 2.2 What Is Google PageRank (PR)? \n\nIn the past, there was a Google Toolbar that provided a PageRank (PR) number of 0 to 10 to indicate how valuable a site was for SEO. \n\nGoogle [eliminated visible toolbar PR](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-pagerank-official-shuts-doors-public/161874/) on April 16, 2016, but SEOs believe that Google still uses an internal PR calculation. \n\nFor more information about the importance of Google’s PR (even though we cannot see it), read Bruce Clay’s [What is PageRank](https://www.bruceclay.com/blog/what-is-pagerank/). \n\nAhrefs, Moz, and Majestic calculations are used by SEOs in place of Google PR to evaluate sites today."
