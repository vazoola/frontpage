  "body": "## PREFACE: What You Don’t Know Can Hurt You\n\nYou may be tempted to ignore SEO and hope your site will do fine without it. The problem with doing so is that what you don’t know can hurt you.\n\nMany site owners have endured the pain, lost time, and expense of trying to recover from penalties in spite of never having built links intentionally.\n\nEven if you do not choose to build links yourself, knowing how to analyze your link profile and guard against negative SEO is imperative.\n\nRead on to find out how.\n\n## Ultimate Link Building Guide 2018\n\nWhile Google may claim that links are not as important as they once were, every ranking factor publication put out by SEOs who do testing shows they are still the [\\#1 factor in getting a site to rank](https://theupperranks.com/blog/backlinks/).\n\nStone Temple did extensive research in 2017 [proving links remain a powerful ranking factor](https://www.stonetemple.com/link-as-a-ranking-factor/).\nAttracting links organically by publishing exceptional content could work, but only if the content is so well-promoted that writers can find it.\n\nIf a site does not have enough authority for its content to appear in search, it surely will not be found in a search engine.\n\nBecause journalists and bloggers primarily use search engines when researching, if your content is not visible there it is unlikely to end up linked to in their content.\n\nThat leaves social media and outreach to build links. So link building will continue to be necessary into the foreseeable future.\n\n## 1.\tDo Keyword Research First\n\nKnowing what keyword phrases are most important to your site and business is the first step. It guides what content you create, publish, and promote and what links you want to acquire.\n\nSEOs use many premium tools which we will discuss later in this paper. But the free [Ubersuggest keyword research tool ](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/)is sufficient to get started. It pulls data from Google which only those who have high AdWords spends can access directly now.\n\nStart with the general words that describe what you offer. Then follow the tips on [how to use Ubersuggest here](http://growmap.com/powerful-keyword-research/).\n\nNarrow your keyword phrases down to those that are highly relevant. Decide by asking yourself whether someone searching for that phrase would be specifically looking for what you offer.\n\n### 1.1 Organizing Your Keyword Research\n\nKeyword research can be exported into spreadsheets. While many exclusively use spreadsheets, others prefer a more visual method.\n\nThe free project management tool Trello is ideal for prioritizing your keywords. You can learn to use it in ten minutes. See this [Trello 101 to get started](https://trello.com/guide/trello-101).\n\nCreate columns for:\n\n* priority\n* too general\n* too competitive\n* specific niches\n* low priority\n\nThen create a card for each keyword phrase showing the keyword, search volume, CPC, and competition value on the front of the card.\n\nEasily sort cards by priority. Create one piece of pillar content for each keyword phrase and add the URL of that content to the card.\n\nThen start building links to that content. Pillar content is also referred to as cornerstone or flagship content.\n\n## 2.\tQuality of Links\n\nBefore you build links, get familiar with how to judge the quality of a site. Various companies have provided metrics to assist in site evaluation.\n\nThe most commonly used is the Moz Domain Authority (DA). Install the free Moz toolbar in your browser to check the DA of any site. Just navigate to a site and activate the toolbar.\n\nAlso available on the toolbar is Page Authority (PA). Where DA is Moz’ estimate of the authority of the main URL of that domain, PA is the authority of any individual page.\n\nURL stands for uniform resource locator. It is what you type into your browser to go to a site online and how that content is found and displayed to you.\n\nIt is important to note that Google states that they score pages on a per URL basis, not over a full domain. But it is still useful to have some idea of the authority a domain may pass to a particular page using Moz’ DA.\n\nAlthough other tools pull data from Moz, they draw from an older version that is not updated as frequently. So the data on the toolbar is the most accurate.\n\nOther metrics available from Moz are MozTrust (mT) and MozRank (mR). On the toolbar, click the Page Analysis (first icon on the left next to “Moz”) to get to these.\n\nThen click on Link Metrics. If a site has a mR or mT, you will see it on that page along with PA and DA.\n\n### 2.1 Relevance is Extremely Important\n\nA pervasive mistake in building links is not to put enough emphasis on relevance. An incoming link from a highly related site is much more valuable than a link from a higher value but less related site.\n\nFocus on getting many very relevant sites in your niche to link to your content. A link from a relevant site is more important than a link from any unrelated site.\n\nLinks from content specifically about your keyword phrase from a quality site that is about your niche should be your priority.\n\nThat does not mean other links may not be valuable. Only the most relevant links should be your target.\n\n### 2.2 What Is Google PageRank (PR)?\n\nIn the past, there was a Google Toolbar that provided a PageRank (PR) number of 0 to 10 to indicate how valuable a site was for SEO.\n\nGoogle [eliminated visible toolbar PR](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-pagerank-official-shuts-doors-public/161874/) on April 16, 2016, but SEOs believe that Google still uses an internal PR calculation.\n\nFor more information about the importance of Google’s PR (even though we cannot see it), read Bruce Clay’s [What is PageRank](https://www.bruceclay.com/blog/what-is-pagerank/).\n\nAhrefs, Moz, and Majestic calculations are used by SEOs in place of Google PR to evaluate sites today.\n\n## 3.\tTypes of Links\n\nPeople use a variety of different types of links. It is useful to know the standard terminology so that you can make inquiries accurately and follow the latest research. Here are some common types defined:\n\n* Homepage link: a link that goes to the primary domain URL\n* Branded link: company name used as anchor text, typically linked to the home page\n* Editorial link: editorial content linked to a comprehensive blog post or other informative, long-form content\n* URL link: a link to yourdomain.com\n* Image alt tag anchor text\n* Brand + keyword anchor text\n* Title anchor text: a link whose anchor text is the title of content on your site\n* Naked link: any variation of anchor text using a URL including those starting with http, www, or just domain.com. (Examples: www.yourdomain.com, http://yourdomain.com, http://www.yourdomain.com, https://yourdomain.com, or https://www.yourdomain.com)\n\nWhile some SEOs insist that it is essential to include naked links while linkbuilding, most writers consider them unnatural and almost never use them.\n\nMike Friedman argues that naked links are not necessary in [this research](https://theseopub.com/naked-url-links-are-not-that-natural/). Publishers and writers would probably prefer you leave them out of content you request.\n\n### 3.1 What Are Nofollow Links?\n\nWhen commenting in blogs became commonplace, Google introduced the practice of adding code to a link to make it “no follow”.\n\nThat is not accurate because robots do appear to follow these links. We know that because they get indexed in search engines.\n\n“No juice” might be more accurate. In theory, links that have the nofollow attribute do not pass what used to be called Google PageRank (PR).\n\n### 3.2 What Are DoFollow Links?\n\nUntil Google introduced nofollow links, there was no such thing as a “do follow” link. Unless a link has a nofollow attribute added to the HTML, it is naturally a dofollow link.\n\nDofollow links are considered more valuable for SEO rankings because they pass “link juice”.\n\n## 4.\tWhat is Anchor Text?\n\nThe words that make up the part of the text that contains the actual link you click on to visit another page are the anchor text.\n\nExample: In this sentence, [click here](https://smallbiztrends.com/2010/02/how-to-use-keywords.html) (typically highlighted in blue and often underlined) is the anchor text. If you want to start a huge debate, argue whether you should use “click here” as anchor text to encourage clicks or not use “click here” because it has no direct value for ranking purposes. \n\n### 4.1 Exact Match Anchor Text\n\nAn exact match anchor text is a link that includes only the specific targeted keyword phrase. For example, if your target phrase were “link building” the anchor text would be [link building](https://www.vazoola.com/resources/link-building-strategies-2018).\n\nExact match anchor text is not as necessary today as it once was because search engines now use semantic search. [Read this](https://www.seoclarity.net/blog/semantic-search-the-most-misunderstood-concept-in-seo) to understand what it is.\n\n### 4.2 Partial Match Anchor Text\n\nPartial match anchor text would contain only some of your keyword phrase or additional words.\n\nHere are some examples for a partial match of the phrase “link building” in the following sentence: “Read this to learn link building safely.”\n\n* Read this to learn [link](https://www.vazoola.com/resources/link-building-strategies-2018) building safely.\n* Read this to learn link [building](https://www.vazoola.com/resources/link-building-strategies-2018) safely.\n  Notice that only the word “link” or alternately, the word “building” would be part of the anchor text.\n  Another method of doing partial match phrases is to include other words:\n* Read this to [learn link](https://www.vazoola.com/resources/link-building-strategies-2018) building safely.\n* Read this to learn link [building safely](https://www.vazoola.com/resources/link-building-strategies-2018).\n\nSee how we created partial match phrases for “learn link” and “building safely” in the anchor text above?\n\n### 4.3 Latent Semantic Index Keywords (LSI)\n\nNeil Patel uses [Latent Semantic Index Keywords (LSI)](https://neilpatel.com/blog/anchor-text/) even though he acknowledges that some feel they are [ineffective](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/latent-semantic-indexing-wont-help-seo/240705/). It can’t hurt if not overdone.\n\n### 4.4 How Anchor Text is Evolving Over Time\n\nEach site owner or writer online tends to link in different ways. At one time, writers would choose the phrase that best describes the page where each link lands.\n\nBut due to pressure from Google, links today will often intentionally avoid using that type of keyword phrase.\n\nOn prominent sites, you will often see anchor text that says “research shows” or “according to” some source rather than anchor text indicating what type of research or what the source discussed.\n\n### 4.5 Be Careful With Exact Match Anchor Text\n\nThere was a time when it was common practice to use exact match anchor text. So if you wanted to rank for “link building” you would get others to link to you using the anchor text phrase “link building”.\n\nIf you do that too much today, Google’s Penguin algorithm is likely to penalize your site. Cautious SEOs now only build one exact match link per phrase.\n\nOthers with premium tools will build based on the percentage of other types of links. A natural link profile has varying ratios of anchor text types.\n\n### 4.6 The Importance of Co-Occurrence\n\nBy including additional words from your target keyword phrase close to your anchor text, you can increase the value of links without the risk of using too much exact match anchor text.\n\nHere’s an example. If the brand name Vazoola often appears near the words “[link building](https://www.vazoola.com/resources/link-building-strategies-2018)”, Google will assume that our site is relevant for searches about link building even though the brand name was not linked.\n\n### 4.7 Understanding Co-Citations\n\nSome SEOs theorize that if a third site mentions two sites as being correlated with each other, Google will recognize a relation between those two sites.\n\n[According to this post](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/co-citation-and-co-occurrence-the-next-big-thing-in-seo/60724/) on Search Engine Journal, co-citations can be an important ranking factor.\n\n## 5.\tWhat is a Natural Link Profile?\n\nBuilding links is not without risk. It is critical to build your backlink profile naturally. You want your link profile to appear organic.\nAvoid focusing only on exact match phrases unless you have done extensive research and know the percentages by type of links pointing at your site.\nThe safest method is to build one link per exact match phrase. Be sure to have a mix of all other link types such as partial match, branded, editorial, URL, and naked.\n\n### 5.1 Average Percentages of Types of Links\n\nThere is no consensus on exact percentages. Some SEOs treat this information as valuable proprietary and confidential data.\n\nOthers have shared their advice publicly. Note how low the exact match percentages are.\n\n### 5.2 Gotch SEO Anchor Text Percentages\n\nIn Gotch SEO’s [Anchor Text updated for 2018](https://www.gotchseo.com/anchor-text/), Nathan Gotch recommended:\n\n* 70% branded\n* 20% naked\n* 5% generic\n* 1-5% LSI or partial match or titles\n* Exact match less than 1%\n\nIn an interview, he said that the naked link percentages will usually come from business listings, press releases, profile links, etc. and not contextual placements.\n\nAnd the reason he recommends such a high percentage of branded links is to keep people out of trouble getting too many anchor text links.\n\n### 5.3 Serpstat Anchor Text Percentages\n\nIn [October 2017, Serpstat suggested](https://serpstat.com/blog/anchor-text-what-is-it-and-how-to-optimize-it/):\n\n* Branded anchor text: 50%\n* Naked links: 20%\n* Generic anchors: 5%\n* LSI, partial match anchors: 1-5%\n* Exact match anchor text: 1-2%\n  As you can see, their recommendations are very similar.\n\n## 6.\tFeatured Snippets\n\nWhat is better than ranking #1 for a search phrase? Having your site at the top of the page in a [Featured Snippet on Google](https://www.blog.google/products/search/reintroduction-googles-featured-snippets/) can be even better. (Some are calling this position 0.)\n\nAn estimated 30-40% of searches are already showing Featured Snippets. Google is likely to continue to increase this number, so targeting these is a good strategy.\n\nIgnore these at your peril. Many sites are seeing their traffic go down even though they still rank in the same place.\n\nAhrefs research shows that clicks on these Featured Snippets are garnering an average of about 8.6% of clicks.\n\nOptimizing for Featured Snippets can be a substantial competitive advantage. The first step is to build links to rank within the top 10 listings.\n\n### 6.1 Ahref’s How to Find and Steal Featured Snippets Manually\n\nAhrefs created a post and video on how to manually find Snippets you already own and how to acquire more.\n\nIn it, they advise:\n\n* \\#1 Find and optimize Featured Snippets you already own (so you keep them)\n* \\#2 Win more Snippets by optimizing your pages that rank in the top 10 positions\n* \\#3 Find Stealable Featured Snippets\n\n### 6.2 Automated Featured Snippet Tools\n\nAhrefs is not the easiest way to optimize for Featured Snippets. There are new, specialized tools to guide you.\n\nGet a jump on your competitors by using Ann Smarty’s Featured Snippet Resources and videos on [how to do Featured Snippet Optimization](https://featuredsnippettool.com/index/resources).\n\n[Ninja Tools created the Featured Snippet tool](https://featuredsnippettool.com/) shown in the image below:\n![Featured Snippet](/images/uploads/featured-snippet-tool.jpg)\n\nThe tool finds and analyzes the 2000 most valuable keyword phrases for your site that are already in the top 15 positions on Google.\n\n\\[Note: Research shows that you need to move up to the top 10 to capture a Featured Snippet 99+% of the time.]\n\nIt shows the Featured Snippets you already own so you can optimize those to make sure you keep them.\n\nTheir “Low Hanging Fruit” feature points out the Featured Snippets that you can most easily capture because your site already ranks higher than the site being featured.\n\nOther data includes what type of Snippets Google shows for:\n\n* keyword research\n* best tags to use\n* searches related to\n* people also ask\n\nUse this data to optimize your pages.\nThere is also a less sophisticated [Rank Ranger Featured Snippet Tool](https://www.rankranger.com/documentation/featured-snippet-tool).\n\n## 7.\tAvoid These Common Mistakes\n\nMany people end up with a very unnatural looking profile similar to the one in this image:\n\n![Link Profile](/images/uploads/link-profile.jpg)\n\nThe reason this happens is that they do not want to pay to acquire links that are under DA30 and they don’t know how to get mentioned on the most significant sites.\n\nIt is a mistake to only end up with links from sites with mid-range DAs. Vazoola is perfect to help you with both higher and lower end sites.\n\n## 8.\tMonitoring Your Backlink Profile\n\nWhether you are actively building backlinks or relying on gaining them organically, it is essential to monitor your backlink profile.\n\nIncoming links should be a mix of types of anchor text and also sources. Too many so-called SEOs with little knowledge will focus on links that are auto-approved and end up with backlink profiles so unnatural they can get your site penalized.\n\nFor example, while links in comments are easy to get, they are low value and typically nofollowed. Too many comment or forum links can be dangerous when you do not have other types of links to balance them out.\n\n### 8.1 Negative SEO\n\nMonitor your backlinks to detect negative SEO so you can work on recovery quickly. Waiting until your income drops dramatically can be costly.\n\nWhile Google claims it can detect negative SEO so that it will not affect your site, some have fallen victim to it.\n\nFor more information, read Search Engine Land’s post on [6 types of negative SEO and how to protect your site](https://searchengineland.com/6-types-negative-seo-watch-272881).\n\nAccording to Neil Patel, negative SEO definitely exists. He offers tips on [how to protect your site from negative SEO here](https://neilpatel.com/blog/spammers-and-negative-seo/).\n\n### 8.2 Google Advice on Viewing Incoming Links\n\nBoth Matt Cutts and John Mueller have [publicly stated](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-recommends-no-longer-using-link-operator/183532/) that using the link:URL command should not be used to find incoming links.\n\nGoogle advises using the “Links to Your Site” report found under the Search Traffic category in the [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console).\n\n## 9.\tRecovering From Penalties\n\nThe first signs your site may be penalized (or have a technical problem) will be dropping traffic or lost sales. \n\nImmediately check your analytics to see if your traffic has dropped off. If it has, drill down to determine what incoming sources of traffic are lower than usual. \n\nWhen organic search traffic drops, and in particular Google organic search, you need to find out why. \n\nImmediately log into Google Search Console to get additional information. (Note that search console was [formerly known as Google Webmaster Tools](https://searchengineland.com/google-webmaster-tools-rebrands-to-google-search-console-221282).) \n\nEvery site owner needs to have access to this free tool and information. Bruce Clay has provided instructions on [How to Set Up Google Search Console](https://www.bruceclay.com/blog/set-up-google-search-console/).  \n\nGo to the Search Traffic > Manual Actions section and check for manual penalties. There will be information online on how to recover from each type.  \n\nYou could start with [7 reasons your rankings suddenly dropped, or how to revert the SEO apocalypse](https://www.link-assistant.com/news/reasons-your-rankings-dropped.html).  \n\n## 10.\tManual Penalties\n\n### 10.1 Unnatural Inbound Links\n\nAn unnatural inbound link penalty is a manual penalty Google levies against a site they believe built incoming links. Negative SEO may also cause this penalty. \n\nSearch Engine Journal provides comprehensive information about [unnatural inbound link penalties](https://searchengineland.com/guide/google-penalties/unnatural-inbound-links) including how to recover. \n\n### 10.2 Unnatural Outbound Links\n\nThe most straightforward penalty to fix is the manual unnatural outbound links because they are all on your site. \n\nWhat most do to recover is to remove or nofollow their outbound links. For comprehensive information read [Predicting Intent: What Unnatural Outbound Link Penalties Could Mean for the Future of SEO](https://moz.com/blog/predicting-intent-what-unnatural-outbound-link-penalties-could-mean-for-the-future-of-seo).\n\n## 11.\tAlgorithmic Penalties\n\nAlgorithms were infrequently updated in the past. If you were penalized by one, you had to wait for the next update to see if your site recovered. \n\nToday, they are “live” and immediately update. Live updates allow you to recover more quickly, but also be penalized much faster. \n\nImmediate updates could make it easier to connect something you did with why you were penalized.  \n\nGoogle algorithmic penalties can be applied at the page level rather than across the entire site. To better understand levels of algorithmic penalties, see this [older Moz post](https://moz.com/blog/pagelevel-algorithmic-penaltie). \n\n### 11.1 Panda Penalty\n\nThe Panda algorithm is a filter intended to weed out poor quality and thin content. It caused particular issues for ecommerce sites and product pages that had only the name of the product or a very short description. \n\nThe short list to not trip a Panda algorithm is: \n\n* Avoid having pages with very little text on them \n* Do not use Flash \n* Fix your 404 errors\n* Delete or improve thin, duplicate, or irrelevant content\n\nTo better understand how to protect your sites from a Panda penalty, read Searchmetrics post [5 ways to definitely get hit by a Panda algorithm penalty](https://blog.searchmetrics.com/us/2014/09/23/5-ways-to-definitely-get-hit-by-a-panda-algorithm-penalty/).  \n\n### 11.2 Penguin Penalty\n\nFirst introduced in April 2012, the Penguin algorithm dropped rankings for sites with unnatural inbound links. \n\nPenguin initially was updated periodically, so any link clean-up done on a site would not change rankings until another Penguin update occurred. \n\nBetween September and October 2016, a new real-time Penguin 4.0 was fully rolled out. See Ignite Visibility’s research for complete details on the [history of Penguin through 2018](https://ignitevisibility.com/google-penguin-update/). \n\nThe most cautious SEOs avoid tripping Penguin by using a specific phrase as anchor text only once. They also keep their exact match anchor text phrases under 1-2% of all links.\n\nAdvanced SEOs actively monitor the percentages of link types to ensure a natural balance so that they may use the same exact match anchor text more than once. \n\nFind out [How to Remove a Penguin Penalty from 58 SEOs Who Share Their Tips](https://niksto.com/penguin-penalty/).\n\n### 11.3 Mobile Friendly Ranking Factor\n\nAlthough this may or may not actually be a “penalty”, Google has [announced](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/02/finding-more-mobile-friendly-search.html) that sites that are not mobile friendly will have their rankings lowered. \n\nThey also show a “mobile friendly” label in the SERPs. (SERPs is a common SEO term that stands for search engine ranking pages or search engine results pages.) \n\n## 12.\tSEO Tools\n\nSerious link builders use a combination of free and premium tools. The ones discussed below are the most commonly recommended. \n\nIt is nearly impossible to decide which is best because they have different strengths and weaknesses. \n\nAdvanced SEOs use many premium tools with monthly fees. Choose wisely to minimize your monthly expense. \n\nStart with the free tools and then add a premium tool. Once you have thoroughly learned it, then you can consider additional paid tools. \n\nThe list below is not complete because there are so many SEO tools, but it does cover the best-known and most-often mentioned. \n\n### 12.1 Ahrefs\n\nAhrefs define themselves as competitor research tools and an SEO backlink checker. In a post updated in early July 2018, they wrote, _“At the moment we stand out from the herd of other similar services by the largest base of Live links, huge Index and the best Speed of index updates.” _\n\nAhrefs announced their [Domain Rank (DR)](https://ahrefs.com/blog/domain-rating/) calculation in January 2018. They also have [other metrics](https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-metrics/) including URL Rating (UR), Domain Rating (DR), Ahrefs Rank (AR) and Keyword Difficulty (KD). \n\nDid you know that [Ahrefs has a free toolbar for Chrome](https://ahrefs.com/seo-toolbar) to make it fast and easy to pull their metrics? \n\nTools offered by Ahrefs are: \n\n* [Site Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer/) for analyzing backlinks of your site and competitors\n* [Content Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer/) to find the most shared content on any topic\n* [Keywords Explorer](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer) for keyword research\n* [Rank Tracker](https://ahrefs.com/rank-tracker) tool to track desktop and mobile rankings for any location; includes the ability to run daily, weekly, and monthly reports\n* [Site Audit](https://ahrefs.com/site-audit) tool to find common SEO issues and monitor your site’s SEO health\n* Alerts notifying you of new & lost backlinks, web mentions, keywords rankings\n\nBe aware that even paid plans have limits on the number of searches you can do. So keep that in mind when using this tool. \n\nThere are comprehensive guides online to make it easier to get the most out of these powerful SEO tools including Nathan Gotch’s [Ahrefs: The Ultimate Guide](https://www.gotchseo.com/ahrefs/). \n\n### 12.2 Majestic SEO\n\nMajestic bills itself as link intelligence tools for SEO, Marketing, and Internet PR. There are huge debates whether Ahrefs or Majestic has a more extensive database of links. \n\nThey also claim to have “The planet’s largest Link Index database”. Majestic and Ahrefs tend to run neck-and-neck for that claim. \n\nMany SEOs prefer one over the other. There is no consensus regarding which one is best. \n\nThe [Majestic SEO toolbar](https://majestic.com/majestic-widgets/plugins) data is free to access. The Majestic toolbar provides the valuable [Flow Metrics ™](https://blog.majestic.com/development/flow-metrics/) for Citation Flow and Trust Flow. \n\nTheir Starter Plan (Lite) has access to their Fresh Index and other commonly used features. \n\nUpgrade to the Pro version to access their Historic Index, other history metrics, and additional features. \n\nMajestic provides [SEO training videos](https://blog.majestic.com/how-to-videos/) to make their many tools easier to learn. \n\n### 12.3 LinkResearch Tools\n\nNot as commonly known, [LinkResearchTools](https://www.linkresearchtools.com/) claims to be able to “simulate the danger of a potential new link” so site owners can avoid Google penalties.  \n\nThey offer a free toolbar and premium tools. \n\n### 12.4 Moz Toolbar\n\nThe free Moz Toolbar is probably the most popular of all the tools because their Moz metrics are widely used to evaluate the quality of websites online. Those metrics were discussed earlier in this white paper. \n\nWhile many writers and site owners use the free Moz Toolbar, fewer know what the difference is between it and Moz Pro. The premium version includes: \n\n* Keyword explorer for keyword research\n* Link profile analysis\n* On page optimization\n* Open site explorer\n* Rank tracking\n* Site Crawl\n\nTheir Content tool was shut down to focus on the SEO tools. Find out more about Moz Pro by reading this updated [2018 Moz Pro review](https://www.martechwiz.com/tools/moz-pro-review/). \n\n### 12.5 SEMrush\n\nBilling themselves as an “all-in-one marketing toolkit”, SEMrush provides tools for SEO, and also paid traffic, social media, content, and PR. \n\nTheir SEO tools include: \n\n* Backlinks audit and analytics\n* Competitive intelligence\n* Ideas for gaining more organic traffic\n* A “not provided” problem solution\n* Position tracking\n* Semantic core collection\n* Technical SEO Audit\n\nTo find out more, read their [SEMrush getting started guide](https://www.semrush.com/kb/15-getting-started). \n\nSEMrush also has their version of SEO metrics they call [SEMrush traffic scores](https://www.semrush.com/kb/747-authority-score-backlink-scores). These include:\n\n* Authority score\n* Page score\n* Domain score\n* Trust score\n\nThe Authority score combines the other scores to measure the overall quality of a domain. \n\nWhen deciding which metrics to use, the G2 crowd [Ahrefs versus SEMrush comparison](https://www.g2crowd.com/compare/ahrefs-vs-semrush) can be useful. \n\n## 13.\tSEO Crawling Tools\n\nThere are multiple crawling tools. Again, there is no consensus regarding which is best. Here are some top choices: \n\n### 13.1 DeepCrawl\n\n[DeepCrawl](https://www.deepcrawl.com/) is a web-based application used to “analyze your website architecture to understand and monitor technical issues to improve SEO performance”. \n\nOnline Performance Agency Roast said, \"Using DeepCrawl means we can spend more time making recommendations and changes and less time trawling through the data\". You can see their [case study here](https://www.deepcrawl.com/case-studies/roast-case-study/). \n\n### 13.2 Screaming Frog\n\nThe [Screaming Frog SEO spider tool and website crawler](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/) _“is a desktop website crawler and auditor for PC, Mac or Linux which spiders websites’ links, images, CSS, script and apps like a search engine to evaluate onsite SEO.”_\n\nIf you have less than 500 URLs, you can use their free version unless you want to use their advanced features. \n\nThey also offer a [Log File Analyzer tool](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/log-file-analyser/) “to upload your log files, verify search engine bots, identify crawled URLs and analyse search bot data and behaviour for invaluable SEO insight”.  It also comes in a free and paid version. \n\nYou can use this tool to [find broken links](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/broken-link-checker/) on your site and fix them. Not repairing broken links can impact your rankings in Google and other search engines. \n\nNote that WordPress sites could also use the [Broken Link Checker plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/broken-link-checker/). It is best not to leave it running all the time as it consumes resources and could slow your site. \n\nFor this reason, some hosting companies forbid sites to use the Broken Link Checker Plugin. Run it, clean up your links, and disable it until you rerun it.\n\n### 13.3 Sitebulb\n\nJames Perrott of [Zazzle Media](https://www.zazzlemedia.co.uk/) said, _“Sitebulb compiles the data integrity of Screaming Frog with the UX of DeepCrawl.”_\n\nIf you’re no fan of using spreadsheets, one benefit of using Sitebulb is the reports: \n\n* Indexation Status by Depth\n* Mobile Rendering\n* Site Speed\n\nIn a [review of Sitebulb](https://builtvisible.com/sitebulb-testing-crawler-tool/) for BuiltVisible, Richard Baxter wrote, _“This tool isn’t a replacement for crawlers like Screaming Frog or products like Ryte – it’s something you’d want in addition to them”. _\n\n### 13.4 Which Crawling Tool is Best?\n\nNot sure which crawling tool you want to use? John Doherty of Credo wrote a comprehensive comparison of the [pros and cons of Screaming Frog, Sitebulb and DeepCrawl](https://www.getcredo.com/screaming-frog-alternatives/).\n\nHe also mentions that Ahrefs, Moz, and SEMrush also include crawlers. See his post for how these compare. \n\n## 14.\tData Intelligence Tools\n\n### 14.1 BuzzSumo\n\nDiscussed further under Tools for Finding Influencers, BuzzSumo is used by content creators, but also by SEOs for doing competitive research on what content is most popular for a given keyword search. \n\n(See discussion below in sectin 15.1 to learn more about BuzzSumo.)\n\n### 14.2 Kerboo Data Intelligence\n\n[Kerboo](https://kerboo.com/) is link audit software that consolidates information from multiple SEO tools. So if you have premium subscriptions to more than one, you may wish to use Kerboo. \n\n### 14.3 SEOClarity for Market Intel\n\nSEOClarity uses Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to collect and analyze the data and turn it into reports for you. \n\n### 14.4 SEMrush\n\nSEMrush is also used for market intelligence. (Jump to discussion 12.5 above about SEMrush above.)\n\n### 14.5 SpyFu\n\nOne of the most popular competitor analysis tools related to organic and paid search is [SpyFu](https://www.spyfu.com/). Because it is so popular, you may want to see the [SpyFu reviews on G2Crowd](https://www.g2crowd.com/products/spyfu/reviews). \n\nAccording to their site, SpyFu enables users to _“Search for any domain and see every place they've shown up on Google: every keyword they've bought on AdWords, every organic rank, and every ad variation in the last 12 years.”_\n\n## 15.\tTools for Finding Influencers\n\n### 15.1 BuzzSumo\n\nBuzzSumo is the primary tool content creators use to determine which content is most popular for any given keyword phrase, who is sharing it, and how influential they are. \n\nThere are so many features inside BuzzSumo, there is too much to cover here. Head over to Backlinko’s [BuzzSumo: The Definitive Guide](https://backlinko.com/buzzsumo-guide) for details. \n\nHow good is it? I used BuzzSumo to find the best content about BuzzSumo! \n\n### 15.2 Klear\n\nAlthough not as well known as Kred once was, Klear categorizes influencers into 60,000 niches. (It doesn’t do you any good to use an influencer whose audience is not interested in what you have to offer.) \n\nUse their influencer search engine to research influencers on specific networks or who post about topics relevant to your brand. \n\n### 15.3 Klout\n\nAlthough [Klout shut down in 2018](https://smallbiztrends.com/2018/05/klout-shutting-down.html), it is mentioned here because they were once very prominent in the influencer space. Now you won’t need to waste your time looking for it. \n\n### 15.4 Kred\n\nKred is an influence score and platform. Unlike some influencer tools that provide only one number for influence, the advantage of using Kred is that they provide separate scores for influencer and outreach level. \n\n### 15.5 Leveraging Influential Content Marketers\n\nRead much more about finding influencers, content marketing, and how to get influential writers to talk about your brand in our other white paper, [Leveraging Influential Content Marketers](http://go.vazoola.com/leveraging-influential-content-marketers). \n\n## 16.\tOutreach Tools\n\n### 16.1 Dibz.me\n\nOne way to find influencers is to use [Dibz.me](https://dibz.me/blog/influencer-research-using-dibz-385). Finding influencers is the simple part. Getting them to respond when you reach out to them is another thing. \n\nThat is why tapping into existing relationships by [using Vazoola](http://go.vazoola.com/are-you-ready-to-build-links) is faster than doing your outreach manually. \n\n### 16.2 Hunter.io\n\nAnother tool for contacting sites is [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io/) which provides potential email addresses based on searches of domain URLs. \n\nAs with Dibz.me, it can be challenging to get a response even if you do manage to find the correct email. There are often many incorrect emails listed, but it is a place to start if you want to do email outreach yourself. \n\n## 17.\tOn-page SEO\n\nThere is more to SEO than link building. Ensuring you have your pages optimized for on-page SEO is just as important. \n\nFind out everything you need to know in Moz’ [On Page SEO – The Ultimate Guide](https://www.bestseofirm.com/best-seo/page-seo-ultimate-guide/).\n\n## 18. Content as an SEO Strategy\n\nAs Google’s algorithms have improved, SEOs like Martin MacDonald have said _“it became easier to just build the best for the query rather than trying to find ever more elaborate linking schemes”. _\n\nHe works in highly competitive niches, currently travel and previously casinos. He says,_ “It’s time to invest in content, and being the “right answer” to queries, not focusing on eeking out % of ranking factors”. _\n\n### 18.1 Quality Content Defined\n\nBefore you build any links you need exceptional content. Even if you ask someone for a link, you cannot have one just because you want one. \n\nThere needs to be something of value for them to link to on your site from their content. \n\nTo attract both natural, organic links you haven’t explicitly requested and to actively build links, endeavor to publish the best possible content on your chosen keyword phrase. \n\nIt should be lengthy and comprehensive. 700+ words are the absolute minimum, and at least twice that is more common. Neil Patel recommends pillar content of about 2,550 words. \n\nOther terms commonly used for pillar content are flagship content and cornerstone content. The SEO plugin Yoast provides a cornerstone content strategy. \n\nThe best way to get journalists and influencers to link to your content is to include current statistics they can quote. \n\nIf your content includes multiple statistics, they may even suggest their readers click through to see more. \n\nEvery keyword phrase you plan to target needs a separate post or page on your site. Then incoming links on that keyword phrase should always be linked to that specific URL. \n\nShort on time to create content yourself? Get introduced to influential content writers by using Vazoola.\n\n### 18.2 How to Create Quality Content\n\nThe easiest way to get ideas about what to write is by researching the top content for the keyword phrase you plan to target. \n\nYou can find this content using Google, other search engines, and BuzzSumo. BuzzSumo allows a very limited number of searches from their free version.  \n\nSerious writers typically use the Pro version which allows unlimited searches and provides additional features. \n\nReview the best content about your keyword phrase. Make notes and add additional ideas as they come to you. \n\nIf you set up a Trello board for your keyword research, you can do this on the card for that keyword phrase. \n\nDo use these notes and ideas to write the most comprehensive content possible on your topic. But be careful not to plagiarize. \n\nOnly original content will rank. And it is not good for a company’s reputation to be accused of stealing content from others. \n\nWhen you’re ready for advance strategies, check into Brian Dean’s Skyscraper Technique. \n\n### 18.3 Add Compelling Media to Increase Views, Shares, and Links\n\nContent that contains images, videos, SlideShares, infographics, graphs, and current statistics gets shared more on social sites and attracts more readers. \n\nWhen journalists and writers are deciding which supporting documentation to link in their articles, they choose the most comprehensive and visually appealing content. \n\n### 18.4 You Get What You Pay For\n\nSkimping on content creation will severely reduce how many will read, share, and link to your site. It will make link building efforts much more challenging. \n\nThe significant difference between cheap content and using an influential writer is accuracy. Any writer can research, read, and regurgitate what they found into a new article. \n\nBut if they are not subject matter experts on the topic, they may have no idea what is correct and what is not. What they write can only be as accurate as the sources they found. \n\nIf you are an expert in your field, consider providing the sources you wish the writer to use. Also be sure to review their content for accuracy. \n\n### 18.5 Plagiarism Checkers\n\nCommonly recommended solutions that provide plagiarism checking include:\n\n* [Copyscape](http://copyscape.com/)\n* [DupliChecker](https://www.duplichecker.com/)\n* [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/plagiarism-checker)\n* [Unicheck](https://unicheck.com/plagiarism-checker-features)\n* [How to use SmallSEOTools Plagiarism checker](https://smallonlinebusinessopportunity.com/how-to-check-your-content-is-unique-using-smallseotools-plagiarism-checker/)\n\nSome of these are web-based with add-ons for specific browsers and solutions. Others you can download to your desktop. \n\nWhen using ghostwriters, you will want to run their content through at least one plagiarism checker. \n\n## 19.

Why You Should Not Wait to Get Started\n\nJosh McCormack of [SiteHerders](https://siteherders.com/) and [Unlofty](http://unlofty.com/) summed SEO and content up well: \n\n_“Life, and SEO, are not a meritocracy. Great content will not rise to the top by itself. It needs to be optimized, promoted and connected. In short, the best answers might be on the 100th page.”  _\n\nIf you don’t want your exceptional content to stay on the 100th page, you need to take action.
