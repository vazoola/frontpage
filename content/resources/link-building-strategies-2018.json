  "body": "Would you like your website to rank at the top of Google for the searches most likely to lead to income for you? Who wouldn't? \n\nThe #1 ranking factor used by Google is inbound links. While some claim links are not as important anymore, David Farkas makes a strong argument why [Links Remain the #1 Ranking Factor in 2018](https://theupperranks.com/blog/backlinks/). \n\nHe cites extensive, comprehensive research undertaken by Stone Temple in 2017 [proving links remain a powerful ranking factor](https://www.stonetemple.com/link-as-a-ranking-factor/). \n\n\n\n\n\nMaking mistakes while link building can be very costly. Tripping a Google algorithm can lead to loss of traffic. Building unnatural link profiles can result in penalties or even de-indexing. \n\nWorst case, some have decided they need to abandon the domain they spent years or maybe even decades building because they have been unable to recover from a penalty. \n\nTake this seriously enough to avoid making these serious errors. Focus on relevancy, quality, and maintaining a natural link profle for safe link building."
